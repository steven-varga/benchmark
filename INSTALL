1. download and install HDF5 v1.10.4 from https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/
from the source tree execute.:
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-build-mode=production --enable-shared --enable-static --enable-optimization=high --with-default-api-version=v110
make -j4
sudo make install
```
NOTE: the system is often shipped with existing hdf5 installation, the supplied CMAKE will be looking in `/usr/local` first. 

2. install libh5cpp-dev:
	a. copy and ship the content of h5cpp/* with your distribution
    b. `sudo make install`
	c. ./configure && make install
